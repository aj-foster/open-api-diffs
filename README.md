# OpenAPI Generator Diffs

This repository contains generated code from [aj-foster/open-api-generator](https://github.com/aj-foster/open-api-generator).
Each tag contains code generated by a different commit of the code generator (whether part of `main` or a pull request).
Using these tags, and the git diffs between them, we can evaluate changes to the code generator.

## Adding a Description

To add an OpenAPI description, complete the following steps:

1. Add the description (Yaml preferred, JSON acceptable) to the `specs/` directory.
   The base name should be a simplified version of the API name (for example, `github.yml` for GitHub's API).
2. Add a corresponding entry in `config.exs`.
   The configuration key should match the name of the description file, and the output should be set to `output/[name]/`.
